Create a device ito use Amazon AWS as your MQTT server, set up a device called dashboard
in AWS IoT and download the starter package

From this you need to copy the files:

dashboard.cert.pem 
dashboard.private.key
root-CA.crt

into the folder $HOME/AWSIoT (or just rename the package to that)

You'll also need to find the hostname (something like XXXXXXXXXX.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com). It's probably
in the start.sh file. Create a new file called "host" and place this as a single line of text.
Add the hosted file to  in the AWSIoT folder.

If the AWSIoT folder exists then listen will use the AWS broker and authentication. Otherwise it will try
and connect to a broker on the local machine
